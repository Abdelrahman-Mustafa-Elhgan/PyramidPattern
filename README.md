# 🏗️ PyramidPattern

## 📄 Description  
A simple C++ program that prints a pyramid pattern of stars based on the number of rows entered by the user. The project demonstrates the use of nested loops and output formatting in C++.

---

## ✨ Features  
✅ Reads the number of rows from the user.  
✅ Prints a well-aligned **pyramid of stars**.  
✅ Uses nested loops to control spaces and stars.  
✅ Beginner-friendly and easy to understand.
